# Mobius Strip Surface Modeling — Python Script

# Task:
You’re asked to model a Mobius strip in 3D using Python, compute some of its geometric properties numerically, and optionally visualize it.

# Mobius strip
A Mobius strip is a famous non-orientable surface with only one side and one edge — like a paper band twisted once and connected end-to-end.

## 📌 Overview
This project models a **Mobius strip** using **parametric 3D equations** in Python, and computes key geometric properties:
- A 3D mesh/grid of (x, y, z) points on the surface
- Approximate **surface area**
- Approximate **edge length**
- Optional 3D visualization

## 📊 Parametric Equation
The Möbius strip is defined by:

$x(u,v) = (R + v \* cos(u/2)) \* cos(u)$

$y(u,v) = (R + v \* cos(u/2)) \* sin(u)$

$z(u,v) = v \* sin(u/2)$


Where:
- $\( u \in [0, 2\pi] \)$
  
- $\( v \in \left[-\frac{w}{2}, \frac{w}{2}\right] \)$
  
- `R` = radius from center to strip midline  
- `w` = width of the strip  
- `n` = mesh resolution  


## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

Install dependencies via:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
````

## 📈 How It Works

The project simulates a **Möbius strip surface** using a **parametric equation-based 3D model**. It then approximates:

* the **surface area** numerically
  
* the **edge length** numerically
  
* and optionally generates a 3D visualization.

### 📌 1️⃣ Define Parameters

The user provides:

* `R` — the distance from the center to the middle of the strip
  
* `w` — the total width of the strip
  
* `n` — the number of points used to discretize the surface (mesh resolution)

Higher `n` = finer mesh = better approximation but slower computation.


### 📌 2️⃣ Generate Mesh Grid of Points

* Values of `u` and `v` are generated using `numpy.linspace`:

  * $u$ from 0 to $2\pi$
    
  * $v$ from $-w/2$ to $w/2$
    
* A **meshgrid** is created from these values using:

```python
self.U, self.V = np.meshgrid(self.u, self.v)
```

This creates a grid of `u` and `v` values to plug into the parametric equations.


### 📌 3️⃣ Apply Parametric Equations

For every point on the mesh grid:

$X = (R + V * cos(U/2)) * cos(U)$

$Y = (R + V * cos(U/2)) * sin(U)$

$Z = V * sin(U/2)$

This converts each `(u,v)` pair into a 3D `(x,y,z)` point on the Möbius strip’s surface.


### 📌 4️⃣ Approximate Surface Area

* **Numerical Differentiation**:
  
  Partial derivatives with respect to `u` and `v` are approximated using `numpy.gradient`

* **Cross Product**:
  
  At each mesh point, compute the cross product of $\frac{\partial r}{\partial u}$ and $\frac{\partial r}{\partial v}$ vectors.
  This gives a vector perpendicular to the tiny surface patch, whose magnitude is equal to the patch area.

* **Add Them Up**:
  
  Multiply each patch area by the small `du` and `dv` intervals and sum over all patches to get total surface area:

$surface area = np.sum(dA) * du * dv$


### 📌 5️⃣ Approximate Edge Length

* Extract the outer boundary points from the mesh
  
* Calculate Euclidean distance between consecutive points along the boundary
  
* Sum those distances to approximate total edge length

### 📌 6️⃣ 3D Plotting

Using `matplotlib`’s 3D plotting module:

* A 3D surface is plotted using the calculated X, Y, Z points
* Axis labels, colors, and title are added for clear visualization

Example:

```python
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap="viridis")
```

## 📊 Workflow

**User Inputs R, w, n → Generates (u,v) Mesh → Compute (x,y,z) → Approximate Surface Area + Edge Length → Plot 3D**


## 📊 Challenges Faced

* Handling numerical differentiation for partial derivatives
  
* Managing surface twisting behavior of Möbius strip in 3D space
  
* Ensuring mesh resolution balances accuracy vs. performance
